                RAM ( Random Access Memory ) is a hardware that allows computers to store and retrieve data from. RAM’s access speed is way faster than on a CD. It is because RAM allows the computer to retrieve data from it randomly so the time taken to access files is way faster than on a CD. Unlike ROM , which is a volatile memory, RAM requires power to keep the data accessible. So if in any instance that your computer’s power is off or computer shuts down, all the data that is inside the RAM is lost and unretrievable.</br> 
	            &emsp; The needs of RAM are really depending on how many applications you run at the same time and how big are the files that you are running, though it is of course the more the better on the memory of a RAM. The amount of RAM used by an application is normally determined by the file of the size. So if you are going to run a video editing application or streaming while playing games, 32GB RAM is the best for you.
