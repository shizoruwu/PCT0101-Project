                The CPU , Also known as the Central Processing Unit or Main Processor, is the “brain” of the computer. It acts as the main processing unit for the whole computer and it connects with other components of the computer such as GPU ,  RAM and Storage to run a computer. The CPU mainly focuses on running the system of the computer and applications in the computer.</br>
                &emsp; The CPU interprets, processes and executes the instructions that are given by the hardware and software which is based on the instructions of the user. After that, the CPU performs arithmetic, logic and other operations to perform the instructions given into output information that are usable. So, the main job for the CPU is to act as the “brain” for everything and process the input instructions and output useful information. The processing speed of the CPU will be mainly determined by the generation of the CPU , the base speed and also the amount of cores that are available on the CPU.</br>
                &emsp; Just some useful information that I've gotten from my friends, regarding that when handling a CPU one must handle it with extreme care because the pins on the CPU are extremely fragile and if any of the pins were bent and the CPU will not function properly.
