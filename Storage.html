                Storage is the place where most, if not all of your storage will be stored. It is the hardware that is used to store all of the storage and retrieved when needed.</br>
                &emsp; There are two types of storage, HDD (Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (Solid State Drive). HDD is the older version of storage disk. It is slower compared to the SSD because most of the data is stored at the disk, known as platter and when needed the time taken to retrieve data is longer. Meanwhile for SSD, all of the data is saved at the flash and it can be saved and retrieved easily so it is way faster than HDD.</br>
                &emsp; Normally storage comes in different capacities such as 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB ++ Of course the higher the capacity it is the more expensive it gets. Although the SSD is way faster than the HDD, the cost of a SSD price are way expensive than a HDD, so you should definitely consider your budget before deciding which one to get for your storage.</br>
