            </p>

            <p>
                Hardware or specification wise, lets talk about CPU first. Out of the 7 people, 2 of them are using an I3 or equivalent, 2 more were using I5 or equivalent and the other 2 were using an I7 or equivalent. The one that stands out the most is the one that are using the I9 or equivalent CPU as this type of CPU is only needed for streamer / video editor so you can actually guess who owns this computer.

            <p>
                <br>&emsp; For GPU, 2 out of the 7 people don't own a dedicated graphic card which shocked me the most, while the other 5 own a dedicated graphic card. From the 5 people that own one, only one person is using the latest version of graphic cards which is the RTX40 series, 2 are using the RTX30 series, one is using the GTX20 series and one is using the GTX 10 series.

                <br>&emsp; Lastly, the RAM and storage. Let's talk about RAM first. One of the people owns a 32GB RAM, while 3 of them owns 16GB RAM and the other 3 owns a 8GB RAM computer.</br>
                    Storage wise, 4 people has 512GB storage, 2 has 1Tb and the last 2 has 2TB of storage.

        <div id="ResultConclusion">
            <p>
                &emsp; In conclusion, I've found out that out of the 8 respondents, almost all of them own a computer and the specifications for their computers vary a lot. This comes to a conclusion that computers could be built in different ways. But which ones are the most suitable, we will discuss them below.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Result1">
            <h3 class="underline"><b>Office Use / Assignment Use Computer</b></h3>
            <p>
                Let's talk about the office use ones first, For an office computer, the specifications should be more focusing on the CPU processing speed and multitasking because on a working computer it is common to open up multiple applications for work uses and this wouldn’t require high graphics requirements so a processing unit with an integrated graphics should be enough for it. It is also recommended to have higher RAM so that the computer doesn't lag and also a higher capacity computer so you can save more work files. 
            </p>
            <pre>
        For examples : The computer could be in the below specifications
                CPU: Intel core I5 - 12600K
                GPU: -
                RAM: 16GB
                Storage: 1TB SSD
            </pre>
            <p>
                This specification computer should be already more than enough for working. The I5 is enough for most of the daily working needs and the 12600K model specifically also has integrated graphics so it's really nice. Other than that the 16GB RAM will also allow them to open more applications at the same time without lagging so they can increase their work efficiency and the 1TB SSD will also give them more storage capacity to save working needed files.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Result2">
            <h3 class="underline"><b>Gaming Computers</b></h3>
            <p>
                Gaming Computers are the most chosen / mostly used ones i would say. This is because most of the gaming computers are custom built and you can choose your own specifications. But here’s the catch, most people don't know what specifications to choose.</br>
                &emsp; Gaming computers mainly focus on RAM and GPU. This is because running a game requires a really good GPU and it also takes up a lot of RAM space so having a higher RAM will prevent your computers from lagging. CPU that are strong isn't required here because running a game will take up alot of RAM and GPU but not CPU because the CPU only has to process the game only and the graphics are already processed by the GPU so the workload is not large for the CPU.
            </p>
            <pre>
        For examples : The computer could be in the below specifications
                CPU: Intel core I5 - 12600H
                GPU: RTX3060/RTX4060
	        RAM: 16GB
	        Storage: 1TB SSD
            </pre>
            <p>
                The following specifications should be good enough for daily gaming needs at 1080p gaming 144Hz gaming. However if you are deciding to play games at 4K 250Hz you can definitely upgrade the GPU to a RTX 4070/4080. Moreover, if you want to stream games at the same time then it's time for you to upgrade the CPU to a I7 - 12700H so it can handle more work loads such as streaming games.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Result3">
            <h3 class="underline"><b>Graphic Designing</b></h3>
            <p>
                Graphic designing is one of the computing needs that requires the most graphic processing. This is because their art projects are usually really large in scale and that makes it incredibly reliant on the GPU. Besides that running an art project also requires a large amount of RAM storage so RAM is aso really important as well. Therefore if one is going to use their computers for graphic designing it should be extremely good.
            </p>
            <pre>
        For examples : The computer could be in the below specifications
                CPU: Intel core I7 - 12700H
                GPU: RTX 4080 / 4090
	        RAM: 16GB / 32GB
	        Storage: 2TB SSD
            </pre>
            <p>
                The RAM could be upgraded based on your needs but the 16GB ones should be able to handle it perfectly without lags. Storage wise it should be optional, just get whichever ones that's enough for you is good, but make sure they are SSD instead of HDD ones.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Result4">
            <h3 class="underline"><b>Video Editing</b></h3>
            <p>
                Video editing is one of the jobs that also requires really strong hardware components including not only CPU, but also GPU and RAM. This is because editing videos could take up alot of memory and also CPU because the data behind a video is huge so you really need a really good CPU to run the video editing applications smoothly. GPU is also needed because it is needed to provide better graphics for you to edit your videos. 
            </p>
            <pre>
        For examples : The computer could be in the below specifications
                CPU: Intel core I7 - 12700H
                GPU: RTX 4070 / 4080 / 4090
	        RAM: 32GB
	        Storage: 2TB SSD 
            </pre>
            <p>
                The RTX 4090 upgrade may be optional , but I do recommend that if you wanna upgrade , upgrade the CPU to Intel Core I9 - 12900H. It should boost you overall performance by a huge step.
            </p>

        <div id="conclusion">
            <h2 class="conclusionunderline"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, all types of hardware components have their own different jobs by handling different tasks of the computers. We've studied how they work and function and also what's the main usage of it.</br>
	            &emsp; Meanwhile, building a computer or desktop may be complicated but once you know what you are gonna use the computer for and know which specifications to get for what type of needs, it is really easy to build a computer. So I hope that more people can learn more about these hardware components so that you can also choose the right specifications of the computer for yourself with ease.
