                A graphic card known as the GPU functions almost the same as a CPU, instead of processing the instructions given, this hardware focuses on processing the graphics of the computer or you can understand it as the image output on the monitor , that is processed by a GPU. The GPU can handle graphics better than a CPU because this is mainly designed to handle pixels of the graphics only and therefore it can reduce the work of the CPU and also increase the processing speed and quality of the graphics.</br>
                &emsp; A dedicated graphic card is mostly only needed when one needs a really high load of graphic processing such as playing 3A games, graphic designs or using it for video editing and streaming. Normally a CPU comes with the option with integrated graphics so you don't have to get a dedicated GPU if it's not needed.</br> 
                &emsp; If it's needed, you can also buy a GPU based on your needs. For example, getting a RTX4090 to play games at 1080P is a huge overkill and its wasting the potential of the GPU and also your money.</br>
