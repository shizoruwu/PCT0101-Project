            <h2><b><i>Introduction</b></i></h2>
            <p>
                Computer hardwares breaks into different computer components that has to be combined together to produce a working computer. This includes <b>CPU ( Central Processing Unit ), Motherboard, GPU ( Graphic Processing Unit ), RAM ( Random Access Memory ), Storage Disks and a PSU ( Power Supply Unit )</b> all the hardwares above combined to produce a working computer.</br> 
                And all the hardwares above does different jobs inside a running computer unit, and all of them are unique. Therefore if any of the hardware components above are missing a computer would not run normally.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; Due to the site and study done in fulfilment of course requirements at Multimedia University, today we are going to look deeper into the functions and working mechanisms of how each and every computer hardware component works such as what a CPU does, making research about how all the computer components works and how it functions etc. More in the theory and the working power for different specifications on the specific hardware components that we’ve found out from research and friends that have the knowledge in this field and that are able to answer some of our questions.</br>  
                &emsp; Later on we'll talk about what kind of different needs would need a better specification on which part of the hardware components and why through our research and testing on currently available computer devices for testing purpose. After our research on that we will make a breakdown list on which hardware is most important for what type of jobs or needs and why it is so. What would be the average budget of your computer based on your needs ? and would it be enough for what you are currently doing ?

        <div class="Process">
            <h2><b><i>The Process and Journey Ive done to get the Results</b></i></h2>
            <p>
                To answer the question above, there are a couple things that will be conducted to obtain the results and analyse them. First we are going to do research about the different components of computer hardware and then make studies about how they function and what they function as, later on we are gonna find out all the hardware specifications that are available in the market and make analysis about their processing power .
                After we did research about the hardware's function and their specifications, we can start going into our main question - Building the perfect computer for you. In this part we are going to find out what specific task one needs to be conducted and we will make results and analyse them according to needs.  We are also going to make a Google Forms to study some of my current community ( friends ) about what they are using their computers for currently and their computer’s specifications. Then we are going to make some analysis about them based on the research and studies that we have done .</br>
